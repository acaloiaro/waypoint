## Local Development

You may wish to link a local clone of the toolkit to a local clone of a
consuming project for rapid development and testing. You can do so with this
command:

```bash
$ yarn dev:link path/to/consuming/project
```

## Components

To create a new component, use the generator:

```bash
$ yarn ember generate component <component-name>
```

## CSS
